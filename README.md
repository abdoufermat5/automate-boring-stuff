## Before you start
please read this article first: [How to use pydrive](https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/)

You will also need to get a gcp account and create a project and enable the drive api
Here a link on how to do that: [How to enable drive api](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python)

> Once you have done that, you will need to download the credentials.json file and place it in the same directory as the test script (example: in the samples folder where the test.py file is)

---

2. Install the requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. create your own script and import the functions you need
4. Dont forget to add the credentials.json (renamed to **client_secrets**) file in the same directory as your script
5. Run your script
